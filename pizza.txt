Then you cover it with [[adjective3]] sauce, [[adjective4]] cheese, and fresh chopped [[plural noun]]. Next you have to bake it in a very hot [[noun3]]. When it is done, cut it into [[number1]] [[shapes]]. Some kids like [[food1]] pizza the best, but my favorite is the [[food2]] pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza [[number2]] times a day!
