PIZZA PIZZA

Pizza was invented by a [[an adjective]] [[a nationality]] chef named [[a person]]. To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of [[a noun]], and make a thin, round [[an adjective]] [[a noun]]. Then you cover it with [[an adjective]] sauce, [[an adjective]] cheese, and fresh chopped [[a plural noun]]. Next you have to bake it in a very hot [[a noun]]. When it is done, cut it into [[a number]] [[a shape in plural]]. Some kids like [[a food item]] pizza the best, but my favorite is the [[a food item]] pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza [[a number]] times a day!
